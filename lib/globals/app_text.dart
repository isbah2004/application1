  static const String aboutMe =
      '''Hi everyone, I am Manthan Moradiya, a student at University Canada West in Vancouver, Canada who is enrolled in a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree. With a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering from Pres.rostkm Sinha, Gujarat Technological University my way to university blends me both technical skills and passion for customer-oriented environments.

To start with, I held a position of Senior Site Engineer at Vaivhaves Developers in Surat, India. there I was accountable for the all the financial aspects, client relations and my duties did not end there I was also responsible of overseeing on-site supervision. Over the years in office, the different experiences have helped me to have outstanding knowledge in communication, teamwork, financial management, and project supervision.

In the way of my ambitions, I was an active participant in bridge design competitions, attending events on the latest technology trends in construction as well as I were a member of the Indian Concrete Institute. These involvements prove my non-stop learning attitude and my increased awareness regarding the actual trends in the cutting- edge industries.

Having garnered fluency in Gujarati, English, and Hindi, I like to embrace cultural diversity and the comprehension of foreign languages helps me to tie with people from other ethnic groups.

On top of academics and job, travelling is to me not a luxury yet a way to meet with my inner self. I equally read literature and listen to music to my heart content. I constantly stay updated about technological advancements.

Inquisitive by pursuing the people's personalities and committed to ensure that customers leave with whole satisfaction, I strive to add value and be part of working environments that calls for innovation.

Dear Company, great that you review my application. I am excited about the possibilities which this role shall give me to utilize my interest, energy and commitment toward making positive impacts.
